summary = '''I will describe the successful combining of commercial satellite data, machine learning, high performance computing, and field measurements that enabled the carbon content of ten billion semi-arid trees to be estimated with an uncertainty of ±20% over an area of 10 million km2. Our results differ from all previous studies using satellite observations and from those based on numerical simulation models. Our voluminous output data required the development of a viewer for understanding what we did, for verification of our tree mapping, and for others to use our results. Because of our extensive training data, we found minimal improvement adding additional satellite data and from cloud & aerosol screening. Our results appeared in the March 2, 2023 issue of Nature.
