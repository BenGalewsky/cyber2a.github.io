Li is a passionate researcher and educator specializing in cyberinfrastructure, AI, and big data analytics and their applications in environmental studies, especially Arctic science. Her innovative research in these areas has won her NSF early CAREER and Mid-Career Advancement (MCA) awards. She is also widely recognized as one of the nationâ€™s leading scientists responsible for the emergence of GeoAI research, a transdisciplinary expansion of AI into the geoscience domains. In the past decade, Li has been experimenting with new approaches to develop and teach machine learning and CI for non-computer science students (majoring in geology, geography, hydrology, biology, urban planning, public health, archeology) at both undergraduate and graduate levels. She will leverage these experiences to work with the team to ensure a successful Cybertraining program for Arctic scientists.
