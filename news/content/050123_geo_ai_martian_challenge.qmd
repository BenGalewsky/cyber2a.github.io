The 2022 GeoAI Martian Challenge is the very first in the series of GeoAI challenges hosted by the Cyberinfrastructure and Computational Intelligence Lab (CICI) and the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC) of Arizona State University (ASU). This is a collaboration among researchers from multiple disciplines, organizations and sectors, including ASU, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Oak Ridge National Lab, Esri, Google and American Geographical Society. The goal of this object detection challenge is to broaden the participation of, but not limited to, students and early career scholars in geospatial sciences, computer science, Earth and space sciences, data science, and fields relevant to this exciting research community. Through this challenge, we also hope to form a strong research network to facilitate collaboration among researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to jointly promote cutting-edge GeoAI research and education, as well as their translational solutions to problems in a wide range of environmental and social science domains.
